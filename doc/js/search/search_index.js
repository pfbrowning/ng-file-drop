If one wants to display custom content for a file input, such as a styled list of selected files, they must resort to one of a number of hacks.\nSetting a \":drag\"-like style on an element with children (similar to the CSS :hover selector) also involves resorting to one of a number of hacks.  Simply setting a property / style on dragenter and removing it on dragleave will not have the desired effect because the dragenter and dragleave events fire on the child elements as you drag through.\nModern browsers generally handle the case of the user dragging and dropping a file on a file input seamlessly: you just drop the file on the input and they're automatically selected.  However, in order to achieve similar functionality in IE11, one must cancel the dragover event and pull the files from event.dataTransfer.files within a drop handler.  Even after doing so, you have to get creative and put the files somewhere else, because you can't programmatically put them in the file input due to security reasons.\nThe \"accept\" attribute only tells the browser to filter the specified file types within the file selection window.  If you want to actually prevent the user from selecting unsupported filetypes, you have to check it yourself with some simple javascript by checking the file size and extension.  It's important to note that you should always implement server-side validation, because a malicious user can easily circumvent any client-side validations.  The purpose of client-side validation is simply to provide a better user experience, and should never be considered a substitute for server-side validation.\n\nDependencies\n\nAngular (requires Angular 6 or higher, tested with 6.0.0)\n\nInstallation\nInstall @browninglogic/ng-file-drop via:\nnpm install --save @browninglogic/ng-file-dropThen include the imported module in your application module:\nimport { FileDropModule } from '@browninglogic/ng-file-drop';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [FileDropModule, ...],  \n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Usage\nBy design, the component has no display of its own and only displays the content that you place inside it.  To use it, simply place an nfd-file-input component within your template and place the non-interactive content that you want to display inside.  The provided content will be displayed, and clicking anywhere on the component will open the browser's file selection dialog.\nConsider this example from the demo:\n\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        {{file['name']}}\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n    Drop Files Here\n    Click or Drag Files Here\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nName\nCategory\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nfilesSelected\nComponent Property\nBoolean\nDenotes whether any files are currently selected.\n\n\nselectedFiles\nComponent Property\nArray\nExposes an array of the currently selected files.\n\n\ndragging\nComponent Property\nBoolean\nDenotes whether the user is currently dragging a file.  Useful for changing the bound content for the duration of the drag.\n\n\nmaxFileSize\nOptional Input Property\nNumber\nThe max file size in bytes to validate for on file selection.\n\n\nallowedExtensions\nOptional Input Property\nString\nA comma-separated list of file extensions to validate on file selection.\n\n\nfilesRejected\nEvent\n\nThis event is emitted when allowedExtensions or maxFileSize are specified and the user selects a file which violates either constraint.  It emits an array of file rejections, each of which contains the file itself and an enum stating which constraint the file violated.\n\n\nclearSelection\nMethod\n\nClears the current selection\n\n\n\nStyling\nThe nfdDragDropHandler class can be used to style the container div.\nIn addition, the nfdDragging class can be used to apply styles while the\nuser is dragging files over the component, similar to the CSS hover selector.\nBoth of the aforementioned classes must be used with the ng-deep combinator.\nThe ng-deep combinator is necessary in order to specify that styles should be \napplied to child components, such as ng-file-drop.  It's worth noting that ng-deep is\ndeprecated and is a\ntemporary solution \nuntil a better solution becomes clear, since this is an evolving topic.  In addition, I would suggest taking a moment to read about \nview encapsulation \nin Angular if you're not already familiar.\nConsider the following example CSS, taken directly from the \ndemo:\n/* Apply some simple styles to the container div directly. */\n::ng-deep .nfdDragDropHandler {\n    cursor: pointer;\n    background-color: #e6e6e6;\n    border: 1px dashed grey;\n    border-radius: 10px;\n    padding: 10px 18px;\n    text-align: center;\n    width:400px;\n}\n\n/* Set a light blue background when in a dragging or hovering state */\n::ng-deep .nfdDragDropHandler.nfdDragging,\n::ng-deep .nfdDragDropHandler:hover\n {\n    background-color:lightblue;\n}\n\n/* Remove the margin / padding / bullets from the file list */\nul.fileList {\n    padding: 0;\n    margin: 0;\n}\n\nul.fileList li {\n    margin:0;\n    list-style:none;\n}Pointer-Events\nSince this component is designed to be a drop-in replacement for a file input, it only supports non-interactive display-oriented content.  Pointer-events are disabled on all of the content inside the nfd-file-input component in order to provide consistent \"drag\" functionality across browsers.  As a side-effect, any pointer-events-based functionality placed inside the component, such as click handlers and :hover selectors, are not supported.  Hover and related CSS selectors can be hooked by using the nfdDragDropHandler CSS class.\nDemo\nView it in action here: https://pfbrowning.github.io/ng-file-drop\nBrowser Support\nThe following browsers have been tested and confirmed to be working as of the specified versions:\n\n\n\nBrowser\nVersion\n\n\n\n\nFirefox\n61\n\n\nChrome\n68\n\n\nOpera\n54\n\n\nInternet Explorer\n11\n\n\nEdge\n42\n\n\nFirefox (Android)\n61\n\n\nChrome (Android)\n67\n\n\n\nI haven't been able to test on Safari for Mac or IOS because I don't own any Macs or IOS devices.  If somebody who does is inclined to report with how it works on either, I would be grateful.\nOn touch devices, the component works as a file input in that it opens the file dialog when you touch it, but \"file drop\" functionality isn't supported for touch devices in that it may or may not work depending on your device.\nDocumentation\nMore detailed documentation can be found here.\nLicense\nCopyright (c) 2018 Patrick Browning.
